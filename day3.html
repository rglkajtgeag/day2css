        The history of tea spreads across multiple cultures over the span of thousands of years. The tea plant
         Camellia sinensis is native to East Asia and probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern China and northern Myanmar
         The British introduced commercial tea production to British India, in order to compete with the Chinese monopoly on tea by stealing green tea leaves from China, transporting them by train/road, resulting in them being fermented and thought fermented tea is the tea drunk in China. 
         Hence the tea drank in the West is mostly fermented and not green fresh tea.

            In Chinese legend, Emperor Shennong was drinking a bowl of just boiled water because of a decree that his subjects must boil water before drinking it.
            [12] Some time around 2737 BC, a few leaves were blown from a nearby tree into his water, changing the color and taste. The emperor took a sip of the brew and was pleasantly surprised by its flavor and restorative properties. A variant of the legend tells that the emperor tested the medical properties of various herbs on himself, some of them poisonous, and found tea to work as an antidote.[13] Shennong is also mentioned in Lu Yu's famous early work on the subject, The Classic of Tea.[14] A similar Chinese legend states that Shennong would chew the leaves, stems, and roots of various plants to discover medicinal herbs. 
            If he consumed a poisonous plant, he would chew tea leaves to counteract the poison.
            A legend dates back to the Tang dynasty. In the legend, Bodhidharma, the founder of Chan Buddhism, accidentally fell asleep after meditating in front of a wall for 9 years. He woke up in such disgust at his weakness that he cut off his eyelids. They fell to the ground and took root, growing into tea bushes.
            [15] Another version of the story has Gautama Buddha in place of Bodhidharma.
